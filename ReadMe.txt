These files together constitute a Recommender System for Toy Museums. The specific goal is to let users find back the toys of their childhood within a larger dataset.


The web application was created in the context of a thesis project at the KU Leuven:

Title: Exploring the use of recommendation techniques in toy museums: a proof of concept and design implications

Author: Jef Scheepers

Promotor: Prof. Dr. Katrien Verbert

Daily Supervisor: Dr. Nyi-Nyi Htun



To run this system, there are two prerequisites:

1) You need to download the different files with images of the toys (Toyimg_appendix_x)s, available in the same GitHub Repository. Add the contents to the folder "toyimg" in this project.

2) This web application makes use of Bootstrap, so an internet connection is required to get the correct style for the eb pages.

Once you have put the files together, run startpage.html.


The dataset used is an adapted version of the 'Historical collections and toys from Deventer Museums' dataset, available on Europeana Curated Datasets (https://pro.europeana.eu/data/deventer-historical-and-toy-museums). A subset of 6000 items was taken and adapted. The original dataset was provided by the Historical Museum of Deventer (https://museumdewaag.nl/) and the Deventer Toy Museum (http://www.speelgoedmuseumdeventer.nl/).
